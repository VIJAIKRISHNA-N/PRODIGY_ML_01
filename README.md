## HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION
This project uses a Random Forest Regressor to predict house prices based on various features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, area, floors, garage, condition, location, and year built.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training is house_price.csv
## Model
The script uses a RandomForestRegressor from sklearn.ensemble to train the model on the dataset. The dataset is split into training and test sets using train_test_split.

## Evaluation Metrics
The model is evaluated using:- Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted values.

## R-squared (R²): 
Indicates the goodness-of-fit of the regression model.

## Visualization
The script generates a scatter plot comparing actual vs. predicted house prices.
